## How to play?
Each card has a numeric value. An ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its fixed value. The player must beat the dealer by getting close to or exactly 21. If you go over 21, you lose.

Once your cards has been delt, you have the following options:
- **Hit**: Take a card from dealer.

The dealer will continue to hit and will try to achieve 17 or higher.
